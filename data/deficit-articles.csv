ap,25-Oct-19,"2019 US federal budget deficit surges to nearly $1 trillion, the highest in 7 years","WASHINGTON  -  The federal deficit for the 2019 budget year surged to $984.4 billion, its highest point in seven years, and is widely expected to top the $1 trillion mark in coming years.

The 26% surge from the 2018 deficit of $779 billion that the government reported Friday reflected such factors as revenue lost from the 2017 Trump tax cut and a budget deal that added billions in spending for military and domestic programs.

Forecasts by the Trump administration and the Congressional Budget Office project that the deficit will top $1 trillion in the current budget year. And the CBO estimates that the deficit will stay above $1 trillion over the next decade.

Those projections stand in contrast to President Donald Trump's campaign promises that even with revenue lost initially from his tax cuts, he would be able to eliminate the federal budget deficit with cuts in spending and increased growth generated by the tax cuts.

The budget showed that revenue rose 4% in the 2019 budget year, which ended Sept. 30, but that spending surged at twice that rate. Spending increased for defense programs and for the government's big benefit programs for the elderly, Social Security and Medicare.  

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asserted that Trump's economic program was nevertheless working, with unemployment at its lowest point in nearly 50 years. Mnuchin argued that to put the budget on a sustainable path, Congress must enact proposals ""to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending.""

So far, though, neither party has shown much interest in reducing the soaring deficits. Trump and Republicans seem content with the $1.5 trillion tax cut measure that Congress passed during Trump's first year in office. And Democrats who are running to oppose him in next year's election have proposed their own expensive spending plans, including Medicare for All.

While pledging to protect Social Security and other benefit programs, many of the Democratic presidential candidates have said they will roll back Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations to pay for their programs.

Against that backdrop, budget deficits are on track to keep rising  -  thereby raising the national debt, as a percentage of the economy, to its highest point since the end of World War II.

The government did previously run $1 trillion annual deficits from 2009 through 2012, when the Obama administration was spending heavily to combat the effects of the 2008 financial crisis and the worst recession since the 1930s.

This time, the deficits are occurring at a dramatically different time: The unemployment rate is historically low, and the economy is in a record 11th year of expansion.

nytimes,25-Oct-19,"Federal Budget Deficit Swelled to Nearly $1 Trillion in 2019
The Treasury Department said the deficit, which came in at $984 billion, will top $1 trillion in 2020.","WASHINGTON  -  The United States federal budget deficit jumped 26 percent in the 2019 fiscal year to $984 billion, reaching its highest level in seven years as the government was forced to borrow more money to pay for President Trump's tax and spending policies, official figures showed on Friday.

The deficit has now swelled nearly 50 percent since Mr. Trump took office and it is projected to top $1 trillion in 2020. It did not hit $1 trillion in fiscal 2019, which ended Sept. 30, but that was largely the result of Mr. Trump's tariffs on trading partners like China, which brought in more than $70 billion in revenue.

The grim fiscal scorecard shows how far the Republican Party, under Mr. Trump, has strayed from conservative orthodoxy, which long prioritized less spending and lower deficits. After years of railing against federal spending while President Barack Obama was in office, Republicans have largely followed the president's lead in cutting budget deals with Democrats that have increased overall government spending.

Annual budget deficits have now increased for four consecutive years, the first such run since the early 1980s. That is a sharp rebuke to Mr. Trump, who promised as a presidential candidate to eliminate deficits within eight years by cutting spending and expanding the economy.

Instead, he has allowed deficits to balloon by enacting sweeping tax cuts and increasing government spending. The rising levels of red ink have come despite a period of sustained economic growth, when budget deficits typically fall as households earn more money, corporations make higher profits and fewer people use safety net programs like unemployment benefits and food stamps. The United States entered its longest expansion on record in July and the jobless rate is at a 50-year low, yet the deficit has continued to widen.

That could be bad news for Mr. Trump, who is heading into a re-election as slowing global growth and festering trade tensions weigh on the United States economy and as stimulus from his $1.5 trillion tax cut fades.

""The current levels of debt are unprecedented in peacetime during a growing economy, and the consequences of this irresponsible spending are unknown,"" said G. William Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

The deficit is growing in large part because tax receipts are falling, as Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts continue to siphon revenue from the Treasury. The numbers reflect the fact that Mr. Trump's most significant legislative achievement is not paying for itself, as Republicans have said it would. In fact, tax revenue for the last two years has fallen more than $400 billion short of what the Congressional Budget Office projected in June 2017, six months before the tax law was passed.

In the year through September, the pace of government spending has grown twice as fast as that of tax revenue, with higher outlays on Medicare, Social Security and military spending.

In the year through September, the pace of government spending has grown twice as fast as that of tax revenue, with higher outlays on Medicare, Social Security and military spending.

""The biggest factor was the tax cuts, which gave a short-term sugar high but now are just contributing to a larger deficit,"" said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, which promotes fiscal responsibility. ""We don't have an economy that's going to grow its way out of this problem.""
The deficit, which is the gap between what the government takes in through taxes and other sources of revenue and what it spends, now sits at 4.6 percent of gross domestic product, up from 3.8 percent of G.D.P. in 2018. Tax revenue accounts for just 16.3 percent of the total economy.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement on Friday that the president's economic agenda was working, pointing to the historically low jobless rate, and called on lawmakers to help the administration cut spending.
""In order to truly put America on a sustainable financial path, we must enact proposals  -  like the president's 2020 budget plan  -  to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending,"" Mr. Mnuchin said.
Fears of trillion-dollar deficits could renew the desire of Republicans in Congress to propose cuts to social programs, like food stamps, Social Security and other safety net benefits. Republicans have long pointed to swelling deficits as a reason to pursue their long-held vision of smaller government, including undoing many of the programs ushered in during the New Deal and Great Society to help the most disadvantaged Americans.
But Republican lawmakers were largely mum on Friday and some of the most vocal fiscal hawks have left Congress. Senator Mike Enzi, a retiring Republican from Wyoming who leads the budget committee, called the country's fiscal path unsustainable and said spending must come down.
""While the federal government's revenue continues to grow, spending is growing twice as fast,"" Mr. Enzi said in a statement. ""We simply cannot afford to continue ignoring the fiscal challenges our nation faces.""

Republicans, who have shut down the government in their quest to cut spending, have enabled the increases that are exacerbating the deficit.
In August, the Senate gave final approval to a two-year budget deal that raised federal spending by hundreds of billions of dollars and allowed the government to keep borrowing money. Democrats agreed to relent on Mr. Trump's demands on military spending in order to satisfy their desire to bolster spending on social programs. Twenty-eight Republicans joined with Democrats to send the bill to Mr. Trump's desk.
Former fiscal hawks such as Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, quietly lamented that agreement as a fact of life in a divided government.
But the mounting red ink has raised a new round of alarm bells from deficit watchdog groups, whose warnings have long gone unheeded in Washington.
The annual budget shortfall is the highest since 2012, when the unemployment rate was twice as high, topping 7 percent, and the economy was emerging from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. By 2029, the national debt is projected to reach its highest level as a share of the economy since the immediate aftermath of World War II.
""Our nation's leaders are in debt denial, running up red ink all while ignoring trillions of dollars in shortfalls for Social Security, Medicare, and other programs that many millions of Americans rely upon,"" said Mitch Daniels, co-chairman of the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""We are at a turning point  -  without action now to phase in reforms over the coming years, Americans will face a much different future than the one that was promised.""
With the deficit growing, it remains unclear how Mr. Trump and the Democrats will address the issue during the election. Democratic candidates such as Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have introduced broad expansions of social safety net programs and have proposed paying for them with big tax increases on the rich.

During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump said that he would eliminate the national debt, which he blamed on Mr. Obama, within eight years. The budget cuts that the president has proposed in his budget plans have been rejected by Congress and Mr. Trump has done little to push them aggressively.
In a July interview with C-Span, Mr. Trump said that if he is re-elected, he would make cutting costs a priority in his second term.
But Mr. Trump has also flirted with the idea of additional tax cuts, such as reducing payroll taxes or taxes on capital gains.
On Friday, before the deficit figures were released, Mr. Trump remained focused on recent increases in the stock market and the low jobless rate.

""The economy is booming,"" he said.

marketwatch,25-Oct-19,U.S. federal budget deficit runs at nearly $1 trillion in 2019,"The numbers: The U.S. government ran a budget deficit of just under $1 trillion  -  $984 billion  -  in the fiscal year that ended in September. It was the largest shortfall since 2012, and was 26% more than the fiscal 2018 deficit of $779 billion. `

As a percentage of gross domestic product, the deficit was 4.6%, up from 3.8% in fiscal 2018.

What happened: The government spent about $4.4 trillion in the budget year that ran from October through September. Outlays for fiscal 2019 were up a record 8% over the prior fiscal year.

Social Security, Medicare and the military were among the major drivers of increased spending.

Outlays on Social Security rose by 6% to $1.1 trillion, while spending on Medicare climbed by 10% to $783 billion. An increase in the number of beneficiaries is partly responsible for higher spending in both programs.

Defense spending increased by 9% to $654 billion. On the flipside, spending for the Department of Homeland Security fell 18%. Outlays for disaster relief were unusually high at the start of fiscal 2018, as the Congressional Budget Office has noted.

Interest payments on the public debt rose 10%.

Receipts totaled $3.5 trillion for the year, up a record 4%. Individual withheld and payroll taxes together rose to $2.5 trillion, an increase of 3%. More money also came in from corporate taxes: they rose by 5% to $277 billion.

The trade war between President Donald Trump and China also had an effect on revenues, with customs duties increasing by 70%. Trump recently called off an increase in tariffs scheduled for Oct. 15 as talks between Washington and Beijing continue.

The annual figure includes a September budget surplus of $83 billion but the government typically runs a surplus for September, as estimated individual and corporate taxes pour in.

The big picture: The jump in the deficit over last year's is a taste of things to come, the Congressional Budget Office has said. In August, the nonpartisan agency estimated a budget deal reached between Trump and Congress would help push the shortfall over $1 trillion in fiscal 2020. The deficit will exceed $1 trillion each year over the subsequent decade, the agency projected.

Meanwhile, as the 2020 presidential campaign heats up, pledges by the candidates could add more to the red ink. In the wake of his $1.5 trillion tax-cut package passed in 2017, Trump has promised more tax cuts and Democrats seeking the White House have proposed programs like Medicare for All, which would cost the government trillions of dollars.

The CBO has warned that rising debt is a risk to the economy. Still, increasing red ink hasn't scared investors away from the financial markets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.40%   has fallen to 1.8% from as high as 3.23% in November. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.02%   is up about 20% for the year.",Robert Schroeder,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-runs-fiscal-2019-budget-deficit-of-nearly-1-trillion-2019-10-25
thehill,25-Oct-19,"2019 deficit nears $1 trillion, highest since 2012: Treasury","The federal deficit for fiscal 2019 reached close to $1 trillion for the first time since 2012, according to final Treasury Department figures released Friday.
In the final accounting, the deficit came in at $984 billion, more than $200 billion, or 26 percent, higher than last year and the same figure the Congressional Budget Office projected earlier in the month.
The deficit, which is projected to grow in 2020, has only surpassed $1 trillion four times in the nation's history, during the four-year stretch following the 2008 global financial crisis.
While President Trump as a candidate had promised to wipe out the nation's debt altogether, it now stands above $22 trillion. The annual deficit, which adds to the nation's overall debt burden, was $587 billion in the last full fiscal year before Trump took office.
""America remains on the fast track to trillion-dollar deficits, rising rapidly as far as the eye can see,"" said Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peterson Foundation, which advocates for debt reduction.
""With all of the important investments we need to make in our future, we find ourselves in a situation where interest costs are the fastest growing program in the federal budget. That's not where we want growth,"" he said.
Net interest, the amount the government pays to service the debt, reached $376 billion, larger than the combined cost of veterans benefits and services and education, and more than half as much as the cost of defense.
The main drivers of the deficit are mandatory programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but recent legislation has contributed to it as well.
The GOP tax law added substantially to the deficit by scaling back revenues, while two bipartisan spending deals added financial resources for both defense and domestic priorities.
CBO has warned that the nation is on an ""unsustainable"" fiscal path. Treasury projected that the 2020 deficit would amount to $1.045 trillion. 
The rise in the deficit during a booming economy is particularly worrying to economists and budget watchers.
A deficit of this size following the longest span of economic growth in history shows just how reckless our leaders have become,"" said former Obama Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, a co-chairman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
""This is exactly the time when deficits should be contracting, not expanding,"" he added.",Niv Elis,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/467488-2019-deficit-nears-1-trillion-highest-since-2012-treasury

		The U.S. government also collected nearly $71 billion in customs duties, or tariffs, a 70% increase compared to the year-ago period.
		The gap between revenues and spending was the widest in seven years. Defense, Medicare and interest payments ballooned the shortfall.
The U.S. Treasury on Friday said that the federal deficit for fiscal 2019 was $984 billion, a 26% increase from 2018 but still short of the $1 trillion mark previously forecast by the administration.
The gap between revenues and spending was the widest it's been in seven years as expenditures on defense, Medicare and interest payments on the national debt ballooned the shortfall.

The government said corporate tax revenues totaled $230 billion, up 12%, thanks to a rebound in the second half of the year. Individual tax revenues rose 2% to $1.7 trillion.
Receipts totaled $3.4 trillion, up 4% through September, while federal spending rose 8%, to $4.4 trillion.
The U.S. government also collected nearly $71 billion in customs duties, or tariffs, a 70% increase compared to the year-ago period. As a percentage of U.S. economic output the deficit was 4.6%, 0.8 percentage points higher than the previous year.
""President Trump's economic agenda is working: the Nation is experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, there are more jobs to fill than there are job seekers, and Americans are experiencing sustained year-over-year wage increases,"" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a press release.
""In order to truly put America on a sustainable financial path, we must enact proposals - like the President's 2020 budget plan - to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending,"" he added.

Annual deficits have nearly doubled under President Donald Trump's tenure notwithstanding an unemployment rate at multidecade lows and better earnings figures. Deficits usually shrink during times of economic growth as higher incomes and Wall Street profits buoy Treasury coffers, while automatic spending on items like food stamps decline.
Two big bipartisan spending bills, combined with the administration's landmark tax cuts, however, have defied the typical trends and instead aggravated deficits. The Congressional Budget Office projects the trillion-dollar deficit could come as soon as fiscal 2020.
Still, the Treasury's report will likely come as a relief to the Trump administration, which had previously forecast that the deficit would hit $1 trillion during the 2019 fiscal year. The White House pushed through a $1.5 trillion tax cut nearly two years ago that President Trump vowed would pay for itself.",Thomas Franck,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/25/federal-deficit-increases-26percent-to-984-billion-for-fiscal-2019.html
